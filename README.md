# SchedulAiApp
A smart desktop calendar assistant built with Python and PyQt5, integrating OpenRouter’s LLM (any can be used) for natural language scheduling and Google Calendar for real-time event management.


# 🗓️ Schedulai — Smart Desktop Calendar Assistant

Schedulai is a desktop-based calendar assistant built with Python and PyQt5, powered by a large language model via OpenRouter (e.g., Mistral-7B or GPT-3.5). It allows users to schedule and manage calendar events through simple natural language commands like:

> "Schedule a call with Sarah tomorrow at 4pm"  
> "Create a test event"  
> "Show me when I'm free"

### ✨ Features
- 🧠 **LLM-Powered NLP** — Understands natural scheduling phrases using OpenRouter's LLM.
- 📅 **Google Calendar Integration** — Authenticated access to view availability, create events, and check for conflicts.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Slot Handling** — Suggests alternative time slots if conflicts are detected.
- 💬 **Interactive PyQt5 GUI** — Chat-style interface with input, output, and event confirmation steps.

### 🛠️ Technologies
- **Python 3**
- **PyQt5** for GUI
- **OpenRouter API** for natural language understanding (Mistral-7B / GPT-3.5)
- **Google Calendar API** for event management

This was an early prototype of the Schedulai platform, designed to bring LLM-assisted scheduling to desktop environments. The project laid the groundwork for a fully web-based assistant with richer features. But feel free to expand on.
